This application is designed for students on a college campus to find tutors that are also fellow students.

If a student wishes to be tutored, they will simply navigate to the class they need assistance in and request to be tutored.

If a student wishes to tutor, they can navigate to a class and indicate that they are able to tutor.  If matches are present, then the students are given the ability to contact each other.

If no matches are present, each student will get an alert with the other student's contact information.
